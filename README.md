# Classification Of Tamil News Articles By Naive Bayes Model Using Natural Language Processing

Machine learning has created a drastic impact in every sector that has integrated it into business processes such as education, healthcare, banking services, etc. The current development of Machine Learning algorithms helps to attain effective Tamil document classification. Automatic text classification aims to allocate fixed class labels to unclassified text documents. NLP problems are unclear for languages other than English. The problems may be named as Entity Extraction, OCR or classification. So in this project we are going to use Naive Bayes model to categorize the Tamil articles in an efficient way. With the help of this Na√Øve bayes technique, the dataset and the trained model we can achieve the desired output within the stipulated time. So that with the help of the trained model, we can achieve the desired accuracy at a higher level.
